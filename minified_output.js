This is usually just an empty file. Keep it open in your preferred IDE or text editor (like Sublime Text for example) and, when the minify_code.py script is running, it will automatically add a minified version of your code to this output file.
It watches for file changes in .js .html and .css files in the same directory the script is running in, and recursively in all subdirectories.
Just remove this text from this minified_output.js file before starting.
